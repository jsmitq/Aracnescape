# Aracnescape

Developed using C# and Unity

Aracnescape is a game I created for my first Ludum Dare event. The game was built in 48 hours using Unity 5.4. The player takes on the role of a spider, who's goal is to navigate the bedroom and escape through the open window on the opposite side. The player must avoid being spotted by the human in the center of the room. As a spider, the player can use the furniture in the room to their advantage by crawling up any surface and even climbing upside-down.
